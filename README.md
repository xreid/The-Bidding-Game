I spent a decent amount of time figuring out which direction to go with this problem. I believe my current solution is about as good as it gets with the method I chose to solve this. Small tweaks may nudge me ahead of some submissions; however, I believe that to make real progress, I would need to do some actual data analysis on the past bids, something which I have yet to look into on my own.

Currently ranked 59 out of 419 submissions
